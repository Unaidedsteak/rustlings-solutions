// tests1.rs
// Tests are important to ensure that your code does what you think it should do.
// Tests can be run on this file with the following command:
// rustlings run --test exercises/tests/tests1.rs

// This test has a problem with it -- make the test compile! Make the test
// pass! Make the test fail! Scroll down for hints :)

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn you_can_assert() {
        assert!(5 >= 5);
    }
}





























// You don't even need to write any code to test -- you can just test values and run that, even
// though you wouldn't do that in real life :) `assert!` is a macro that needs an argument.
// Depending on the value of the argument, `assert!` will do nothing (in which case the test will
// pass) or `assert!` will panic (in which case the test will fail). So try giving different values
// to `assert!` and see which ones compile, which ones pass, and which ones fail :)
